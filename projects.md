### My Projects:

- **BATech 165 Project: 911 Call Center Staffing Model**
  - Imported and processed over 100,000 911 calls from the Seattle Police Department public database into Excel.
  - Utilized PivotTables and advanced statistical functions in Excel to analyze and summarize 911 call data by location, time of day, and responder type (e.g., fire, police).
  - Resulted in actionable insights, which enabled call center management to optimize the call center staffing level to reduce response time and improve service quality.
  
- **CS 211 Project: Google Weather API Webservice Application**
  - Designed and developed a webservice application that uses a Google Weather API to extract, analyze, and display real-time weather data to end users.

- **INFO 201 Project: CO2 Emission Forecasting Model**
  - Collaborated with a team to gather datasets from various public sources, which included CO2 emission levels and various environmental factors (e.g., forest area, fertility rate, electricity usage).
  - Leveraged R programming with tidyverse and ggplot libraries to merge, clean, and prepare data for analysis, to identify key variables that impact CO2 emission levels.
  - Developed a CO2 emission forecasting model based on this dataset.

- **INFO 330 Project: Homeless Shelter Database Management**
  - Created a schema for a homeless shelter database.
  - Generated mock data matching the schema, and added them to a database in SQL studio.
  - Performed SQL functions on the data to reach findings.
