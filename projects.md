### My Projects:

- **911 Call Center Staffing Model**
  - Imported and processed over 100,000 911 calls from the Seattle Police Department public database into Excel.
  - Utilized PivotTables and advanced statistical functions in Excel to analyze and summarize 911 call data by location, time of day, and responder type (e.g., fire, police).
  - Resulted in actionable insights, which enabled call center management to optimize the call center staffing level to reduce response time and improve service quality.

- **CO2 Emission Forecasting Model**
  - Collaborated with a team to gather datasets from various public sources, which included CO2 emission levels and various environmental factors (e.g., forest area, fertility rate, electricity usage).
  - Leveraged R programming with tidyverse and ggplot libraries to merge, clean, and prepare data for analysis, to identify key variables that impact CO2 emission levels.
  - Developed, trained, and evaluated a CO2 emission forecasting model using linear regression, forecasting emissions with 90% accuracy.

- **Google Weather API Webservice Application**
  - Designed and developed a webservice application that uses a Google Weather API to extract, analyze, and display real-time weather data to end users.

- **Homeless Shelter Management Database**
  - Designed and implemented a comprehensive database schema tailored for managing homeless shelter operations.
  - Developed and populated a robust SQL Server database with realistic mock data, simulating real-world scenarios.
  - Executed complex SQL queries to analyze data, uncovering key insights to optimize resource allocation and improve shelter services.
